# IbexRL: Online Learning for HVAC Control with Differentiable MPC

IbexRL is an advanced control algorithm designed for optimizing HVAC systems in building environments. It leverages a core agent built on Differentiable Model Predictive Control (dMPC), enabling it to learn and adapt its control strategy online.

The framework supports two primary operational paths:
1.  **Imitation Learning (IL) + Online Learning:** A two-stage process where the agent is first pre-trained to mimic a baseline controller and then refined through online reinforcement learning.
2.  **Online Learning Only:** A direct approach that uses pre-trained IL parameters to immediately begin the online learning phase.

## üèõÔ∏è Repository Structure

Here are the key files and directories in this project:

* `IbexAgent.py`: The core of the project. Contains the differentiable MPC agent logic.
* `online_learning_main.py`: The main script to execute the online reinforcement learning experiments. **This is the primary file you will run.**
* `online_learning2.py`: Contains the main simulation loop that interacts with the BOPTEST environment. **Modify this file to adapt to new environments.**
* `train_imit.py`: The script used to run the initial imitation learning phase from scratch.
* `Gnu-RL/`: This directory contains baseline data generated by the default BOPTEST controller, which is used for both imitation learning and as a source of disturbances during online learning.
* `imit_environment.yaml`: Conda environment file for imitation learning.
* `online_environment.yaml`: Conda environment file for online learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Before running any experiments, you must set up the appropriate Conda environment.

### 1. For Imitation Learning (Optional)

If you plan to run the imitation learning phase from scratch, create and activate the `rl-imit` environment:

```bash
# Create the environment from the .yaml file
conda env create -f imit_environment.yaml

# Activate the environment
conda activate rl-imit
```

## üöÄ Usage

There are two ways to use this framework.

### Path A: Using Pre-Trained Models (Recommended)

This is the quickest way to get started. It skips the imitation learning step and uses pre-computed model parameters to begin online learning directly.

1.  **Activate the Environment:** Make sure you are in the `rl-online` Conda environment.
    ```
    conda activate rl-online
    ```
2.  **Configure the Main Script:** Open `online_learning_main.py`. You will need to configure two sections:
    * **File Paths:** At the top of the file, update the following paths to match your local machine's directory structure:
        ```
        BOPTEST_GYM_PATH = '/path/to/your/project1-boptest-gym'
        repo_path = '/path/to/your/Ibex_RL/agent'
        gnu_rl_path = '/path/to/your/Gnu-RL'
        mpc_path = '/path/to/your/diff_mpc_library'
        ```
    * **Hyperparameters:** Inside the `Args` class, you can adjust various parameters for the experiment. See the **Configuration** section below for details on key parameters like learning rates (`state_lr`, `action_lr`), cost calibration (`cost_calibration`), and exploration (`explore`).
3.  **Run the Experiment:** Execute the script from your terminal. It will loop through the number of runs specified in the code.
    ```
    python online_learning_main.py
    ```

### Path B: Running Everything from Scratch

Follow this path if you want to generate your own imitation learning model before starting the online learning phase.

1.  **Run Imitation Learning:**
    * Activate the `rl-imit` environment.
    * Configure and run `train_imit.py`. This will train the agent to mimic the baseline controller data located in the `Gnu-RL` folder and save the initial model parameters.
2.  **Run Online Learning:**
    * Follow all the steps in **Path A**.
    * Crucially, in the `Args` class within `online_learning_main.py`, make sure the `IL_...` parameters (`IL_ETA_FOR_PATH`, `IL_FHAT_EPOCH`, etc.) point to the results of your imitation learning run.

## üîß Configuration Details

All major hyperparameters are located in the `Args` class inside `online_learning_main.py`.

* `state_lr`: Learning rate for the state-space model parameters (e.g., thermal resistance).
* `action_lr`: Learning rate for the cost function parameters (`O_hat`, `R_hat`).
* `cost_calibration`: Set to `True` if you want to learn the cost parameters online. This is necessary if you are using a custom, non-quadratic reward function.
* `IL_...` **parameters**: These variables tell the script which pre-trained imitation learning model to load as the starting point for the online phase.
* `explore`: Set to `True` to enable exploration by adding noise to the agent's actions. `sigma_init` controls the initial amount of noise.
* `folder_name`: The name of the directory where the experiment results will be saved.

## üåç Adapting to a New Environment

To apply this agent to a different BOPTEST environment, you need to modify `online_learning2.py`.

1.  Open `online_learning2.py`.
2.  Navigate to the `test_loop` function.
3.  Update the following variable definitions to match the observation and control signals of your new environment:
    * `state_name`
    * `dist_name`
    * `ctrl_name`
    * `target_name`
    * The `boptest_obs_config_for_env` dictionary, which defines the names and ranges of all variables to be pulled from the environment.
